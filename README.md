# [TrueLayer](https://truelayer.com) - [Docs](https://docs.truelayer.com)
TrueLayer allows financial applications to connect securely with their customerâ€™s bank data. TrueLayer provides a unified interface between multiple financial institutions and third party applications over a common RESTful API. 
For more information and for obtaining a new TrueLayer developer account, visit https://truelayer.com. 

# TrueLayer client library - JavaScript / TypeScript

This is the official Typescript client library that helps with the creation of applications that use TrueLayer APIs. Typescript is a typed superset of Javascript that compiles to plain JavaScript. More information regarding Typescript can be found at: https://www.typescriptlang.org/

The truelayer-client-javascript library can be used from either JavaScript (Node.js) or TypeScript.

# Installation

```bash
$ npm install truelayer-client
```

# Usage
Below is a simple Javascript express app using TrueLayer's API client library. It illustrates the flow of obtaining a JWT access token from the authorization server, before using this token to query the data api `/info` endpoint for identity information of the user.

```javascript
const {AuthAPIClient, DataAPIClient} = require("truelayer-client");
const app = require("express")();

const redirect_uri = "http://localhost:5000/truelayer-redirect";

// Create TrueLayer client instance
const client = new AuthAPIClient({
    client_id: "<client_id>",
    client_secret: "<client_secret>"
});

// Generate and redirect to authentication url
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    // Read JSDocs for descriptions for all parameters
    const authURL = client.getAuthUrl(redirect_uri, ["info"], "nonce", "");
    res.redirect(authURL);
});

// Receiving POST request
app.post("/truelayer-redirect", async (req, res) => {
    // Exchange an authentication code for an access token
    const code = req.body.code;
    const tokens = await client.exchangeCodeForToken(redirect_uri, code);
    
    // Call to the Data endpoint using the access token obtained. Eg. /info endpoint
    const info = await DataAPIClient.getInfo(tokens.access_token);
    
    res.set("Content-Type", "text/plain");
    res.send(`Access Token: ${JSON.stringify(info, null, 2)}`);
});
```

# [Examples](https://github.com/TrueLayer/truelayer-client-javascript/tree/master/examples)

Two sample applications have been created and are available to run from the `./examples` folder.
In order to run the examples, `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` need to be set as environment variables. These can be obtained by signing up on https://truelayer.com.
Set the environment variables from the console:

```bash
$ export CLIENT_ID="<client>"
$ export CLIENT_SECRET="<secret>"
```

## [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

This simple example stands up a bare-bones express server that takes a user through the authentication flow and hits the data API endpoints, streaming the results to a page. Run it from the command line:

```bash
$ cd examples/express
$ npm install
...
$ npm start
```

Once the app is listening, navigate to `http://localhost:5000` and introduce credentials.

## [Koa](http://koajs.com/)-[Marko](http://markojs.com)

Koa is a next-generation web framework designed by the team behind Express, which aims to be a smaller, more expressive foundation for web applications and APIs.

Marko on the other hand is a lightweight full featured open-source frontend framework with remarkable performance. It is heavily inspired by the work from vue, react and angular.

This demo showcases the flow from client application, to TrueLayer auth dialog and back again in a fictional single page personal finance management application.

```bash
$ cd examples/koa-marko
$ npm install
...
$ npm start
```
# Authentication and tokens

> Note: The code snippets below are extracted from the above Express example.

The flow of authorization follows the protocol of [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) and can be can achieved via this client in the following 4 steps:

1. The first step in authentication is to redirect the user to the TrueLayer Authentication Server. 

    ```javascript
    const authURL = client.getAuthUrl(env.REDIRECT_URI, scope, "nonce", state = "", true);
    res.redirect(authURL);
    ```

2. Upon successful redirect and authentication, a one-time code is generated when the HTTP POST is performed to the redirect_uri provided by the client.

    ```javascript
    app.post("/truelayer-redirect", async (req, res) => {
        const code = req.body.code;
        ...
    });
    ```

3. After the code is obtained, this can be exchanged for an access token.

    ```javascript
    const tokens = await client.exchangeCodeForToken(env.REDIRECT_URI, code);
    ``` 
4. The authorization server will respond with:
    * *access token* - short-lived JWT token (default 1h) used to access data on behalf of the customer
    * *refresh token* - long-lived code used to obtain a new access token

> In the case that the `access_token` has expired, ```refreshAccessToken``` can be used for refreshing the token. This will return new values for both the access_token and refresh_token (old refresh_token no longer valid).

# [Project structure](https://github.com/TrueLayer/truelayer-client-javascript/tree/master/src/v1)

This client library comprises of two pieces of functionality represented by separate classes:

### 1. Authentication - [AuthAPIClient](./src/v1/AuthAPIClient.ts)
* This is responsible for providing methods that allow developers to perform customer authentication and client authorization.
* The following methods are provided in AuthAPIClient:
    * `getAuthUrl` - builds a correctly formatted authentication url used for redirection to the authentication server.
    * `exhangeCodeForToken` - exchanges an authentication code for an access token
    * `refreshAccessToken` - refreshes the access token using the refresh token. Access tokens expire after a set period of time (default 1h). 
    * `isTokenExpired` - checks whether the current access token is still valid.

### 2. Data APIs - [DataAPIClient](./src/v1/DataAPIClient.ts)
* Once the authentication is successful, methods are provided for calling the various API endpoints for obtaining information regarding the authenticated bank account such as : accounts, balance, transactions etc.
* The following methods are provided in DataAPIClient:
    * `getMe` - call to the */me* endpoint
    * `getInfo` - call to the */info* endpoint
    * `getAccounts` - call to the */accounts* endpoint
    * `getAccount` - call to the */accounts/{account_id}* endpoint
    * `getTransactions` - call to the */accounts/{account_id}/transactions* endpoint
    * `getBalance` - call to the */accounts/{account_id}/balance* endpoint


# Errors
Errors are handled using the `APIError` class. The errors returned will have the following format:
```json
{
    "name": "error_name",
    "message": "error_message"
}
```

# Tests
The client library has both integration and unit tests.

> In order to run the integration tests, an access token needs to be provided. If this is not provided, only the unit tests will be run.

```bash
$ export access_token=<access_token>
$ npm run test
```
