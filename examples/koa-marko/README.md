# [Koa](http://koajs.com/) + [Marko](http://markojs.com)

Koa is a next-generation web framework designed by the team behind Express, which aims to be a smaller, more expressive foundation for web applications and APIs.

Marko on the other hand is a lightweight full featured open-source frontend framework with remarkable performance. It is heavily inspired by the work from vue, react and angular.

This demo showcases the flow from client application, to TrueLayer auth dialog and back again in a fictional single page personal finance management application.
